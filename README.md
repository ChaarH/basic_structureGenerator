# basic_structureGenerator
A simple script to generate common project files

Who has never needed to create multiple files that are part of a CRUD? And there is always a need to create Controllers.

This simple script is intended to create these files based on the objects they will add to the _construct () Array.

Feel free to improve and modify;)
